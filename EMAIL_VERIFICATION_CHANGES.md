# Email Verification Feature Implementation

## Summary
This document outlines the changes made to implement email verification banner and fix the logout issue when users with unverified emails try to create listings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created EmailVerificationBanner Component
**File:** `src/pages/profile/EmailVerificationBanner.jsx`

- Similar to ProfileCompletionBanner
- Displays when user's email is not verified (`user.email_verified === false`)
- Clicking the banner triggers a resend of the verification email
- Uses blue color scheme to differentiate from profile completion banner (yellow)

### 2. Fixed API Client to Handle Email Verification Errors
**File:** `src/api/apiClient.js`

**Problem:** When users with unverified emails tried to create listings, the API returned a 401 error. The interceptor was treating all 401s as authentication failures and logging users out.

**Solution:** Added logic to detect email verification errors and prevent logout:
```javascript
// Check if the error is due to email verification
const errorMessage = error.response?.data?.detail || error.response?.data?.message || '';
const isEmailVerificationError = errorMessage.toLowerCase().includes('email') && 
                               (errorMessage.toLowerCase().includes('verif') || 
                                errorMessage.toLowerCase().includes('unverified'));

// Don't log out for email verification errors
if (isEmailVerificationError) {
    return Promise.reject(error);
}
```

### 3. Updated User Transform Utility
**File:** `src/utils/userTransform.js`

Added `email_verified` field to user transformation:
```javascript
email_verified: userData.email_verified ?? false,
```

### 4. Updated MyPosts Page
**File:** `src/pages/Dashboard/MyPosts.jsx`

Changed from hardcoded `true` to actual user data:
```javascript
const isEmailVerified = user?.email_verified ?? false;
```

### 5. Added EmailVerificationBanner to Multiple Pages

The banner was added to the following pages to remind users to verify their email:

- **Dashboard** (`src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`)
- **CreateItemListing** (`src/pages/Dashboard/CreateItemListing.jsx`)
- **CreateRoomateListing** (`src/pages/Dashboard/CreateRoomateListing.jsx`)

## User Flow

1. **Unverified User Sees Banner**: When a user with an unverified email logs in, they'll see a blue banner at the top of the dashboard and listing creation pages.

2. **Click to Resend**: Clicking the banner automatically resends the verification email to the user's registered email address.

3. **Attempt to Create Listing**: If user tries to create a listing without verifying:
   - The API will return a 401 error with email verification message
   - The app will **NOT** log them out (this was the bug)
   - An error toast will appear explaining they need to verify their email
   - The modal in MyPosts page prompts them to verify

4. **After Verification**: Once verified, the banner disappears and users can create listings normally.

## Backend Requirements

The backend should:
1. Return `email_verified` boolean field in user data
2. Return appropriate error messages for unverified email attempts that include words like "email" and "verif" or "unverified"
3. Example error format: 
   ```json
   {
     "detail": "Email verification required to create listings"
   }
   ```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Banner appears for users with `email_verified: false`
- [ ] Banner does NOT appear for users with `email_verified: true`
- [ ] Clicking banner sends verification email
- [ ] User is NOT logged out when they try to create listing with unverified email
- [ ] Error message is displayed when unverified user tries to create listing
- [ ] Banner disappears after email is verified
- [ ] Resend email functionality works and shows appropriate toast messages

## Visual Differences

- **ProfileCompletionBanner**: Yellow with warning icon - for incomplete profiles
- **EmailVerificationBanner**: Blue with mail icon - for unverified emails

Both banners are clickable and take appropriate action when clicked.
